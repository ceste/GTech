How read assess this exercise:



I started this exercise from Jupyter Notebook. I have two notebook, each for different dataset. These notebook would not create model and save all the necessary data. 

To do all that thing run:

```
python run.py 
```

It will create all the models and the supporting files. 

To test the web request on local computer, open terminal and run below :

And then open another terminal and run below:

If you host this on cloud, go to config.py and change the LOCAL_URL value and run 

```
python request.py 
```

It should give you the same result as if you run it on local.
